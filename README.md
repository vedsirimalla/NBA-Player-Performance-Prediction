# NBA-Player-Performance-Prediction

A comprehensive deep learning project analyzing and predicting NBA player performance using multiple neural network architectures.

## Overview
This project analyzes NBA player statistics from the 2023-2024 season to predict **Points Per Game (PPG)** using various deep learning models. The analysis includes data processing, exploratory data analysis, and implementation of six different neural network architectures.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** NBA Player Stats Dataset (2023-2024 Regular Season)
- **Initial Records:** 5,522 entries
- **Processed Records:** 1,989 entries
- **Features:** 33 statistical categories

---

## Data Processing Pipeline
1. Removed duplicate entries and outliers
2. Handled missing values using mean imputation
3. Created new features:
   - **Points Per Minute**
   - **Total Rebounds**
   - **Shooting Efficiency**
4. Normalized numerical features using `StandardScaler`
5. Split data into training and testing sets
